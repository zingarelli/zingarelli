### Welcome! üëã

Thank you for visiting my GitHub Profile! 

üéì My goal is to become a **Front End Developer**, to turn your concepts and ideias into responsive and interactive web pages. 

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning **React** and expanding my knowledge in **JavaScript**. 

üì´ You can message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zingarelli/) or send me an [e-mail](mailto:zingarelli.m@gmail.com). 

### Projects üñ•Ô∏è
Most of my repos are projects developed in the courses I take at [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br), a brazilian online school of technology. 

Although I'm documenting my recent projects in English, most of them are in Portuguese. If any of those in Portugues piques your interest and you want to know more about it, please contact me.

üîñ In order to help you, below you can find some projects I've selected and organized by topics, with links to the repo and online version (when available):

**HTML | CSS | JavaScript**

- ‚ú®[Alura Geek](https://github.com/zingarelli/alurageek): this is currently my biggest project, in which I've developed several pages for a fictitious e-commerce company. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript, "mobile first design" and BEM methodology. Products are displayed dinamically (using a mocked API response), form fields have HTML and JS validation, login and searchbox are functional (you can search products by name).  [View it online](https://zingarelli.github.io/alurageek/). 

- ‚ú®[One Piece Matching Game](https://github.com/zingarelli/desafios-bootcamp-TQI-DIO/tree/main/JavaScript): my favorite one! It's a matching game based on One Piece characters, developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no external libraries). [View (and play!) it online](https://bootcamp-tqi-dio-javascript.vercel.app).

- [Personal Website](https://github.com/zingarelli/desafios-bootcamp-TQI-DIO/tree/main/HTML_CSS): one of my first HTMLL/CSS projects, where I learned how to create a responsive layout, with animated menu and background, and hover effects for buttons and images. [View it online](https://desafios-bootcamp-tqi-dio.vercel.app). 

- [Alura Books](https://github.com/zingarelli/alura-books): responsive home page for a fictitious e-commerce bookstore. It was developed with a "mobile first approach", and I applied Flexbox to position elements. It also has a [form page](https://zingarelli.github.io/alura-books/form.html) and a [books page](https://zingarelli.github.io/alura-books/livros.html), in which I use JavaScript to fetch data from an API and work with arrays (using functions like `filter()`, `map()` and `sort()`). [View it online](https://zingarelli.github.io/alura-books/).

- [Robotron](https://github.com/zingarelli/robotron-2000): in this project I learned how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript. It's a responsive and interactive page where the user can personalize their own robot (Robotron), by selecting its color and choosing how many of different parts the robot will have. [View it online](https://robotron2000-js-dom.vercel.app).

- [Say the number](https://github.com/zingarelli/say-the-secret-number): a simple game where the user has to guess the number by saying it aloud. It was used the Web Speech API for speech recognition. [View it online](https://zingarelli.github.io/say-the-secret-number/) (use Google Chrome for a better support of the Web Speech API).

**ReactJS**

- [One Piece Messenger](https://github.com/zingarelli/AluraCord-Online_Transponder_Snail): yes, I'm a big One Piece fan üòä. This was my first React project, where I developed a messenger app for the Straw Hats gang. It's possible to send messages and stickers. It uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) to mock a backend. [View it online](https://aluracord-online-transponder-snail.vercel.app) (unfortunately, Supabase puts on hold databases for inactive projects, so maybe the app won't load properly - sorry for that). 

- [GitHub Profile Search](https://github.com/zingarelli/desafios-bootcamp-TQI-DIO/tree/main/react-js): this was a project developed to learn how to work with GitHub API and how to use Styled Components. You can type a GitHub username and the page will show some of the user's information and repos (styled as cards). [View it online](https://desafios-bootcamp-tqi-dio-ivory.vercel.app).

---

**TypeScript | Angular**

- [Alura Broker](https://github.com/zingarelli/alura-broker): my first project developed in TypeScript, it's a simple page to place and view stock orders. It's also possible to import data from API (but you need to install and run the server locally). [View it online](https://zingarelli.github.io/alura-broker/app/dist/index.html).

- [Memoteca](https://github.com/zingarelli/memoteca): this application was developed in order to learn the basics of Angular 14. In it, you can save a thought/favorite quote and also view a mural with saved thoughts, which you can edit or delete.

---

**Data Science**

- [Churn rate analysis](https://github.com/zingarelli/Alura_Voz-Data_Science_Challenge): this project was part of a Data Science Challenge proposed by Alura. It consisted in a full data analysis for a fictitious telecom company, regarding their customer churn rate. I was challenged to clean the data, create plots to verify variables that could help understand which customers were evading the company and then create two Machine Learning models to classify customers who could potentially cancel their voice/internet plans.
