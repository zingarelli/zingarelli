### Welcome! üëã

Thank you for visiting my GitHub Profile! 

üéì My current goal is to become a **Front End Developer**, to turn your concepts and ideias into responsive and interactive web pages. 

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning **JavaScript**, **TypeScript** and **React**. 

üì´ You can message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zingarelli/) or send me an [e-mail](mailto:zingarelli.m@gmail.com). 

### Projects üñ•Ô∏è
Most of my repos are projects developed in the courses I take at [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br), a brazilian online school of technology. 

Although I'm documenting my recent projects in English, most of them are in Portuguese. If any of them piques your interest and you want to know more about, please contact me.

üîñ In order to help you, below you can find some projects I've selected and organized by topics, with links to the repo and online version (when available):

**HTML | CSS**
- [Personal Website](https://github.com/zingarelli/desafios-bootcamp-TQI-DIO/tree/main/HTML_CSS): responsive layout, with animated menu and background, and hover effects for buttons and images. [View it online](https://desafios-bootcamp-tqi-dio.vercel.app). 

- [Alura Books](https://github.com/zingarelli/alura-books): responsive home page for a fictitious e-commerce bookstore. Here we applied "mobile first design", used flexbox to position elements, and media queries to create layouts for larger screens (1024 and 1728 pixels). [View it online](https://zingarelli.github.io/alura-books/).

**JavaScript**
- ‚ú®[One Piece Matching Game](https://github.com/zingarelli/desafios-bootcamp-TQI-DIO/tree/main/JavaScript): this is one of my favorites! It's a matching game based on One Piece characters, developed using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. [View (and play!) it online](https://bootcamp-tqi-dio-javascript.vercel.app).

- [Robotron](https://github.com/zingarelli/robotron-2000): in this project I learned how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript. It's a responsive and interactive page where the user can personalize their own robot (Robotron), by selecting its color and choosing how many of different parts the robot will have. [View it online](https://robotron2000-js-dom.vercel.app).

- [Say the number](https://github.com/zingarelli/say-the-secret-number): a simple game where the user has to guess the number by saying it aloud. It was used the Web Speech API for speech recognition. [View it online](https://zingarelli.github.io/say-the-secret-number/) (use Google Chrome for a better support of the Web Speech API).

- [Alura Books](https://github.com/zingarelli/alura-books): Beside the home page described in the HTML | CSS topic, Alura Books also has a form page and a books page. In form page, we use JavaScript to fetch address data from an API to autofill some inputs. In books page, we use JavaScript to work with arrays. [View it online](https://zingarelli.github.io/alura-books/).

**ReactJS**
- [One Piece Messenger](https://github.com/zingarelli/AluraCord-Online_Transponder_Snail): yes, I'm a big One Piece fan üòä. This was my first React project, where I developed a messenger app for the Straw Hats gang. It's possible to send messages and stickers. It uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) to mock a backend. [View it online](https://aluracord-online-transponder-snail.vercel.app) (unfortunately, Supabase puts on hold databases for inactive projects, so maybe the app won't load properly - sorry for that). 

- [GitHub Profile Search](https://github.com/zingarelli/desafios-bootcamp-TQI-DIO/tree/main/react-js): this was a project developed to learn how to work with GitHub API and how to use Styled Components. You can type a GitHub username and the page will show some of the user's information and repos (styled as cards). [View it online](https://desafios-bootcamp-tqi-dio-ivory.vercel.app).

**Data Science**
- [Churn rate analysis](https://github.com/zingarelli/Alura_Voz-Data_Science_Challenge): this project was part of a Data Science Challenge proposed by Alura. It consisted in a full data analysis for a fictitious telecom company, regarding their customer churn rate. I was challenged to clean the data, create plots to verify variables that could help understand which customers were evading the company and then create two Machine Learning models to classify customers who could potentially cancel their voice/internet plans.
